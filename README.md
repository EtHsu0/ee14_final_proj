# ee14_final_proj
## COMMIT RULES:
- [add] (msg)
- [delete] (msg)
- [fix] (msg)
- [test] (msg)

### Use case:
Add: Adding new piece of code\
Delete: Deleting existing code\
Fix: Fixing/modifying existing code\
Test: Code that does not change the functionality of the program (for example,
        debugging outputs, commenting out sections of code, etc.)\

Please inlcude 1 sentence of message for each commit that is readable and understandable by everyone!

### Folder usage:
DO NOT EVER MODIFY THE TEMPLATE FILE\
Duplicate the template file if you want to start a test on something.\
FINAL_PROJ will be where the final production code is located \
PRINT_TEST will be where tests related to printing function on UART be \
Feel free to duplicate a new folder to test out stuff.
Notes: If you are familiar with git brance, feel free to use it as alternative. HOWEVER, using folder and copy code that is guaranteed to be corrected to FINAL_PROJ will be a better option to avoid pull request mess.
